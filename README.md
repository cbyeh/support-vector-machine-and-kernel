For more details, see pa3.pdf

## Dependencies

Requires python 3, as well as numpy and pandas.

Easiest way to get numpy is with the command `pip3 install numpy`, and likewise for pandas `pip3 install pandas`.

## TODO

Make more general for other datasets.

Use other kernels, possibly Radial Basis Function.

Make code more pythonic.
